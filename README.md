# Olist-E-commerce-Analysis-Project
# Introduction:
The Olist Store Analysis project aims to analyze customer purchasing patterns and payment statistics on an E-commerce platform, Olist. This project covers several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as weekday vs weekend sales, payment statistics, delivery time, and customer behavior. The analysis is based on nine CSV files, which are cleaned and manipulated to extract valuable insights.

### KPI 1: Weekday Vs Weekend (order_purchase_timestamp) Payment Statistics
The analysis of payment statistics based on weekday vs. weekend provides an understanding of the buying behavior of customers. This KPI answers questions like, which day of the week has the highest sales? How many customers prefer to pay through online modes? The analysis of this KPI can help Olist to improve their weekend sales and plan promotions accordingly.

### KPI 2: Number of Orders with review score 5 and payment type as credit card
This KPI analyses the number of orders with a review score of 5 and payment type as credit card. This helps in understanding customer satisfaction levels and payment preferences. Olist can use this information to identify satisfied customers and encourage them to make repeat purchases.

### KPI 3: Average number of days taken for order_delivered_customer_date for pet_shop
This KPI analyzes the average number of days taken for order_delivered_customer_date for pet_shop. It helps Olist in identifying areas where they can improve their delivery time and maintain customer satisfaction.

### KPI 4: Average price and payment values from customers of sao paulo city
The analysis of average price and payment values from customers of Sao Paulo city helps in understanding the spending patterns of customers in this region. It also helps Olist in identifying high-value customers and creating targeted marketing campaigns.

### KPI 5: Relationship between shipping days (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp) Vs review scores
This KPI analyzes the relationship between shipping days and review scores. It helps in understanding the impact of delivery time on customer satisfaction levels. Olist can use this information to optimize their logistics and improve their delivery time.

## Conclusion:
The Olist Store Analysis project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and payment statistics. The analysis of these KPIs helps Olist in identifying areas of improvement and creating targeted marketing campaigns. As a data analyst, I have used Excel and Power BI to clean and manipulate the dataset and create meaningful visualizations. This project serves as a great example of how data analysis can help businesses make informed decisions.
